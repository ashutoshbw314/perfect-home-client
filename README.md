# Perfect Home client side code (Assignment 11)
***[Perfect home](https://perfect-home-0.web.app/)*** is a practice MERN stack site imitating characteristics of a service providing company.

## Client side features
* Each page is responsive.
* Buttons that perform async actions are disabled while the action is running.
* As extra home feature I added shop or career related section.
